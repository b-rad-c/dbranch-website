    <h1>The Branches</h1>
    <div className='content'>
        <h3>Audience:</h3>
        <p>Independent media is already demonstrating the crowd’s ability to shift the overton window. dBranch will magnify this effect by giving viewers not only the ability to fund journalists but also to fund studios and democratically control access. The audience will also be able to create funding pools, or bounties, to reward investigative researchers and/or reviewers to work on a specific topic.</p>
        <p>Individuals may participate in one or more audience DAOs that enable people to pool their money and control its distribution. dBranch will maintain open source software that enables DAOs to easily create a customizable funding structure with voting rights for its participants. It could be as simple as pooling donations for a small group of otherwise independent journalists, or as complex as funding an entire ecosystem, ensuring a portion of the funds go to one or more organizations in each branch.</p>

        <h3>Contributors:</h3>
        <p>Journalists, anchors, analysts, etc. will all publish work as contributors, and by decorrelating their income from clicks, they can write how they want rather than how the algorithms want. Krystal and Saagar have demonstrated this with their show, Breaking Points.</p>

        <h3>Investigative Research:</h3>
        <p>Investigative journalists are vital to the news but difficult to fund. Their work often takes weeks or months with little to show for it. Dollar for dollar, a quick article about an inflammatory tweet is profitable, but that doesn’t mean it’s valuable to the audience. </p>

        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>dBranch will have an academic style of review, grading content on data, citations, logical reasoning, etc. Additionally, we’ll have creatives judge the content on subjective qualities like sensationalism, clickbait, and talking around the truth. Reviewer’s income will also not be tied to the click rate of published content which will open up their honesty.</p>

        <h3>Studios, office & field crew:</h3>
        <p>DAOs will fund and control physical assets, such as studios, field crew equipment, and office space. It will function similarly to public studios, except the members of the DAOs will be able to vote on and control who has access.</p>

        <h3>Curators:</h3>
        <p>Curators create the feeds, effectively the homepage of the decentralized news industry. Following the same funding model as the contributor branch, curators will not be forced to list content with the goal of retaining attention.</p>
